# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Isael!
Iâ€™m a Physicist interested in quantum computing and computational physics in statistical physics.  
Currently, I'm learning algorithms of quantum computing, awk in linux, simulations in dissipative particle dynamic, LAMMPS, and methods to analize the outdata of mesoscopic simulations.  
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on quantum computing.
