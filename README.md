- 👋 Hi, I’m @Taquitoo3000
- 👀 I’m interested in quantum computing and computational physics in statistical physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning algorithms of quantum computing, awk in linux, simulations in dissipative particle dynamic, LAMMPS, and methods to analize the outdata of mesoscopic simulations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on quantum computing.
