# 👋 Hi, I’m Isael!
👀 I’m interested in quantum computing and computational physics in statistical physics. I’m currently learning algorithms of quantum computing, awk in linux, simulations in dissipative particle dynamic, LAMMPS, and methods to analize the outdata of mesoscopic simulations.
I’m looking to collaborate on quantum computing.

# Education
Master's Student in Physics, Universidad de Guanajuato
Bachelor's degree in Physics, Universidad de Guanajuato
